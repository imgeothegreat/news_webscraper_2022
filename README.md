#Still underwork not fully working

# Data Collected:
#News Headline
#News Link
#Data Published

CSV File is called data.csv

#NOTES
Some website links from CNN are from their own websites and they only use /self links with no HTTPS from the beginning. That is why I made a function that
automatically adds an "edition.cnn.com" text before each link.
