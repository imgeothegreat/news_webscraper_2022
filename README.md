# news_webscraper_2022
Collects news Headlines from CNN and NBC News every day. Data collected automatically converted to a CSV File.

# Still have missing features but the program already works. Still missing save to pdf, send email, machine learning algo, auto backup data

# Data Collected:
*News Headline
*News Link
*Data Published

CSV File is called data.csv

# NOTES
Some website links from CNN are from their own websites and they only use /self links with no HTTPS from the beginning. That is why I made a function that
automatically adds an "edition.cnn.com" text before each link.
